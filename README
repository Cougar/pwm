BUILDING AND INSTALLING

You will need a C-compiler, gnu make :-(, BSD-compatible install and an
editor.

    1. Edit system.mk to suit your system. If heavy modifications
       are required, you might want to save the file somewhere for
       future use (and hope that I don't change the makefile-system...).
    2. If you want to customize pwm above what is possible with
       pwm.conf, edit config.h (this step is optional)
    3. make depend && make. Note that 'make' here refers to gnu make
       which is usually named 'gmake' on systems with their own version
       of make.
    4. make install (not required if you manually setup configuration
       files).

       If you are using gnome or whatever that creature is called,
       there is also 'install-gnome' target that should install the
       file PWM.desktop somewhere. This does not mean PWM is gnome
       compliant. It isn't and will not be, at least not before
       there is a common standard with KDE. Disclaimer: I am pretty
       indifferent about these DE's and this desktop-file is just a
       contribution I decided to include.


NOTICE: PWM WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT A PROPER CONFIGURATION FILE!

Without a configuration file no keys or mouse buttons will be bound to
any actions and you will get a  black and white color scheme.
Either personal ~/.pwm/pwm.conf or system-wide $(PREFIX)/etc/pwm/pwm.conf
must exist unless another specified on the command line.
$(PREFIX) is the path where you told to install PWM in the Makefile
and the default setting is /usr/local.


CONFIGURATION

Have a look at config.txt and the default configuration files.
